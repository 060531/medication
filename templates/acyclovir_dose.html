    <!-- Uses Section -->
    <div class="section-title">Uses</div>
    <p><strong>Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, known or suspected:</strong> 
    Acyclovir treatment should be initiated in all infants with herpes disease. In asymptomatic neonates born to women with active herpes lesions, initiation of acyclovir is dependent on risk of transmission to the neonate. Adverse effects (AE) were common, but severe AEs were rare with a median dose of acyclovir 60 mg/kgday IV in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n-89 newborn infants)</p>

    <!-- Dose Regimen -->
    <div class="section-title">Dose Regimen</div>
    <p>Based on results from a clinical trial, the standard dose and dosing interval is 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (60 mg kg/day). Although mortality rate was reduced when compared with the 30 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours) regimen, the 60 mg/kg/day regimen still demonstrated a 24-month mortality rate of 31% among infants with disseminated HSV disease and 6% among infants with CNS HSV disease. Furthermore, the dose did not improve the rates of normal infant development.
    Investigators of a small population pharmacokinetic study proposed the following frequencies for a 20 mg/kg dose: every 12 hours for infants less than 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) (n=13 ), every 8 hours for infants 30 to less than 36 weeks PMA (n-9), and every 6 hours for infants 36 to 41 weeks PMA (n-6) to achieve a surrogate pharmacodynamic acyclovir target concentration of 3 mg L or more. This target concentration theoretically would achieve CSF concentrations of I mgLor more. Safety and efficacy were not evaluated with these regimens. One infant experienced an elevated serum creatinine, which was considered related to acyclovir. Doses greater than 80 mg/kg day (range 87 to 158 mg kg day) were administered to 47% of neonates (15 out of 32 infants)</p>

    <!-- Neonatal HSV infection, Chronic suppressive therapy -->
    <div class="section-title">Neonatal HSV infection, Chronic suppressive therapy</div>
    <p>Based on data reported from 2 parallel, phase Ill, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (n-45 with CNS disease; n=29 with skin, eye, mouth (SEM) disease), 6 months of suppressive oral acyclovir therapy (300 mgm'dose 3 times a day started immediately after IV treatment for CNS HSV disease was associated with better neurological outcomes when compared with placebo. Of the 28 infants with CNS disease assessed at 12 months (acyclovir=16; placebo-12), Bayley Scales of Infant Development 2nd Edition) Mental Scores were significantly higher in patients receiving acyclovir compared with patients receiving placebo (88.24 vs 68.12; p-0.046) In patients with SEM disease receiving 6 months of suppressive oral acyclovir therapy started immediately after IV treatment, the time to 2 recurrences of skin lesions was 1.7 months longer in the treatment group compared with placebo. Of the 15 infants with SEM disease assessed at 12 months, there were no differences in Bayley scores between acyclovir and placebo. An absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm' or less was reported in 20% to 25% of patients receiving acyclovir compared with 5% to 7% receiving placebo; no patient had complications associated with neutropenia.
    In one case series (n-16), infants treated for CNS or disseminated HSV disease received oral acyclovir suppressive therapy for 2 years. Starting doses were 1200 to 1600 mgm' every 12 hours to achieve an acyclovir peak serum concentration greater than 2 mcg/mL. There was no control group; however, the authors concluded there were improved neurological outcomes in this cohort based on comparisons with historical information from other studies. In another case series (n=9) of infants with neonatal HSV infection n=8 with CNS disease; n= I with recurrent dermal and ophthalmic disease who received oral acyclovir suppressive therapy, initial oral acyclovir doses were 600 to 1400 mgm' every 8 to 12 hours. The mean acyclovir dose required to achieve the target peak concentration of 2 mcgmL or greater was 1340 mgm'dose given every 12 hours. Long term neurological development was normal in 7 of the 9 children; the 2 children who developed neurological impairment experienced a delay in oral therapy following completion of parenteral acyclovir therapy</p>

    <p><strong>Varicella-zoster virus infections with CNS and pulmonary involvement.</strong> Acyclovir treatment is recommended in infants with varicella-zoster infection having CNS or pulmonary involvemen</p>

    <div class="section-title">Adverse Effects</div>
    <p><strong>Common Adverse Effects: </strong> Common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, and rash</p>

    <p><strong>Cardiovascular: </strong> Hypotension requiring inotropes (9%) occurred in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n-89 newborn infants treated for herpes simplex virus disease)</p>

    <p><strong>Hepatic: </strong> Elevations of hepatic transaminases (1% to 2%) and hematologic abnormalities less than 1% have occurred</p>

    <p><strong>Hematologic: </strong> Leukopenia (16%) and thrombocytopenia (25%), which occurred within a median of 1 to 2 days, were common in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n-89 newborn infants treated with high-dose acyclovir for herpes simplex virus disease). Neutropenia occurred in 6% of infants, most of whom were treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Severe hematologic events were rare (0% to 3%).
    Among infants receiving high-dose acyclovir for neonatal HSV disease, the major toxicity was neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1000mm<sup>3</sup>), which was observed in 21% of children.
    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, resulting in death, have been reported in some immunocompromised patients receiving acyclovir. Overall, hematologic abnormalities occurred in less than 1%</p>

    <p><strong>Immunologic: </strong> Resistant viral strains may emerge during long-term therapy; these patients are at high risk for progressive life threatening disease</p>

    <p><strong>Neurological: </strong> Seizures (9) occurred in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n 89 newborn infants treated with high-dose acyclovir for herpes simplex virus disease)</p>

    <p><strong>Renal: </strong> Mild elevations of creatinine concentrations (2%) were reported in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n-89 newborn infants treated with high-dose acyclovir for herpes simplex virus disease)</p>

    <p><strong>Renal: </strong> Mild elevations of creatinine concentrations (2%) were reported in a retrospective review of Pediatrix Medical Group data (n-89 newborn infants treated with high-dose acyclovir for herpes simplex virus disease)<br>Grade 3 or higher nephrotoxicity was observed in 6% of children. Renal failure, in some cases fatal, has been reported. Use caution if giving concurrent nephrotoxic drugs. Dose adjustment required in renal impairment. Risk of transient renal dysfunction and crystalluria is minimized by slow infusion rates (over at least | hour) and adequate patient hydration.</p>

    <p><strong>Vascular: </strong> Phlebitis may occur at IV site due to alkaline pH of 10</p>

    <!-- Monitoring -->
    <div class="section-title">Monitoring</div>
    <p>Periodic CBC. Follow renal and hepatic function. Monitor IV site for phlebitis-if noted, make infusion solution more dilute</p>

    <!-- Pharmacology -->
    <div class="section-title">Pharmacology</div>
    <p>Antiviral drug that is preferentially taken up by infected cells; inhibits viral DNA synthesis. CSF concentrations are 30% to 50% of serum concentrations. Oral absorption is 15% to 30%. Most of administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine, primarily via glomerular filtration. Protein binding and metabolism are minimal. Serum half-life is 3 to 4 hours in patients with normal renal and hepatic function.<br><br>The clearance increased with time in the premature neonate from 0.21 | Uhrkg for those less than 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), 0.449 Lhrkg for those 30 to less than 36 PMA, and 0.589 Lhrikg for those 36 to 41 PMA in a population pharmacokinetic study (n-28). The corresponding half-lives were 10.2 hours, 6.55 hours, and 3 hours. For 20 mgkg doses, the IV frequency suggested was every 12 hours for infants less than 30 weeks PMA, every 8 hours for infants 30 to less than 36 weeks PMA, and every 6 hours for infants 36 to 4l weeks PMA. These regimens were then assessed using a data set of 1000 infants to simulate acyclovir exposure. The proposed dosing regimens predict that the steady state plasma concentration at 50% of the dosing interval would be greater than or equal to 3 mg/L in greater than 90% of infants. Although, toxic levels are unknown, concentrations associated with neurotoxicity in a small amount of patients have been identified as 50 to 70 mg L. These predicted neurotoxic concentrations were exceeded in 0.9% and 0.3% of infants, respectively.
    <br>Dosing simulations of the proposed and standard dose regimens using a database of 1000 infants provide the following percentages of infants who would be expected to achieve a target concentration of 3 mg/L or more</p>
